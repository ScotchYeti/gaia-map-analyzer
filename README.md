Analyse maps of the "Gaia Project" boardgame with regards to scoring potential and balance

# Introduction

**Gaia Project** (see [boardgamegeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/220308/gaia-project)) is a boardgame with 14 different factions and a variable map. The question came up how a map favors one faction or another and which qualities are important. Obvious things were that *planets at the edge are a disadvantage* or that *clusters are good*. 

With the introduction of [boardgamers.space](https://www.boardgamers.space/boardgame/gaia-project) people can play Gaia Project online. Not only that, all games are stored in a database and we have the chance to analyze them deeply. 

The *Gaia Map Analyzer* is a personal project that uses the available games to answer the following questions:

1. What is the scoring potential of a map for faction 1-14?
2. Is the map **balanced** and provides equal potential for all factions in play? 

# Implementation

The whole project is still in an early alpha phase. The idea is to train a neural network to provide a score for each faction. 

# Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+
* tbd
